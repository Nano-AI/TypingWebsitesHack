### :warning: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS CODE
Hacks for one website.
- [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com/).
- [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/).

> :warning: The cheats might not work. Check the warnings section in this file.

## Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory to install all requirements.

## Usage
To run the file type `python {name of website}.py` (Check at the top of website for list of websites that work).
Hit enter in the Terminal to launch a new race, hit enter in the terminal again, once the text
box loads in, hit enter in the Terminal again. Once the race starts, hit enter in the typing box to start the hack.

## :warning: Warnings
- [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com/) - Going too fast at the qualifying race will cause NitroType 
to queue you with people that are as fast as you (When you're going past the world record, there's nobody that you can 
go against other than other cheaters). If you go too fast, you're queued with bots because they're the only thing
"close" enough to beat you.
- [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) - This website actually has cheat detection. If you go too fast with too high
accuracy, you will get kicked. This means you have to limit how fast the program can type. The website will
ask you to do a test if you go over 100 WPM.
